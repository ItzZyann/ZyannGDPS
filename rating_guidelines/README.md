# ZYANN GDPS RATING GUIDELINES

Welcome to the Zyann GDPS Rating Guidelines! If you want your level to be rated, here's what you need to know:

## 1. Level Length
Your level should fall into one of these categories: medium, long, XL, or XXL. Short levels may be considered if they demonstrate exceptional quality.

## 2. Decoration
Ensure your level boasts good decoration, avoiding the pitfalls of "recent levels." Even layouts can be rated if their structure is commendable or feature-worthy.

## 3. Song
Avoid overused songs and instead opt for fresh tracks from Newgrounds. Sync your level with the music for a deserving rating.

## 4. Readable
Make sure your level is easily readable. Avoid excessive effects or elements that might confuse players or make understanding difficult.

## 5. No Secret Ways
Keep your level straightforward with no secret ways.

### Guidelines Update
Stay tuned for upcoming updates to the guidelines!

Feel free to adapt these guidelines to your Zyann GDPS 2.2 rating system, ensuring a fair and enjoyable level creation and rating experience.
